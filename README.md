### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Johannes UlÃ©n. I'm a Swedish developer, focused on full-stack development. I've been programming since I was around 8 years old, when my father introduced me to Basic of all things via some programming book with cartoon robots in it (please contact me if you know what book I'm talking about).

Stuff I like or am interested in in no particular order:
* JS
  * React
  * Vue
* Python
  * FastAPI
* Elixir
  * Phoenix
* Zig
* Rust
* PHP
  * Laravel
* SQL databases, especially Postgres
* Game development
